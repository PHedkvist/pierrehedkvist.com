			<h3>MSc in Computer Engineering</h3>
			I studied for 5 years at <a target=_blank href="https://liu.se/">Linköping University</a> in Sweden. During my
			<a target=_blank href="https://www.ida.liu.se/edu/ugrad/program/profiler/pal/index.sv.shtml">masters degree</a> I focused on software development and
			algorithms. I began my journey at becoming a better software developer, striving to write code more efficiently,
			more concise and structured. I love solving problems, letting my mind take a problem and finding a solution
			to it gives me an incredible satisfaction.

			<br><br>

			<h3>Master Thesis</h3>
			In my master thesis I researched and implemented a collaborative graph editing tool, where multiple people in
			real-time can collaboratively create a graph consisting of nodes and edges (think of Google Docs, instead of text, a
			graph is being edited). The thesis was done together with an Indoor Positioning System company called <a target=_blank  href="https://senion.com/">Senion</a>.
			The algorithms that was researched is called <a target=_blank  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">Operational Transformation</a> (OT)
			and <a target=_blank href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type</a> (CRDT). They area
			used in order to solve problems in distributed applications, where the consistency model being used is called
			eventual consistency. The problem revolves around users being able to work on local data where edits are eventually
			merged together with other users, and all users data converge to the same state without any conflict or data loss.
			I implemented a proof of concept application using React, Typescript and  Kotlin.

			<br><br>

			<h3>Unitalent</h3>
			During my final year of studies I worked at a student consulting company called
			<a target=_blank href="http://unitalent.se/">Unitalent</a>, where I developed software for
			clients. I enjoyed talking to customers and figuring out a way to solve their problems.
			I focused mainly on creating applications using my favorite web-application framework called
			<a target=_blank href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. It is a great tool in order to get started
			writing code fast, because it is a full-stack framework, one does not have to spend any time on configuration,
			everything works out of the box. I created an app called <a href="https://www.foodforlifters.com/">Food For Lifters</a>
			which is used for weight loss, by calculating caloric intake which are used in recipes that the users can cook for themselves.
			I created a website for an athletic club called <a href="http://unitalent.nocout.se/">NocOut.se</a>, its based on wordpress.

			<br><br>

			<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>
			I am fan and <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pulls?q=is:pr+author:PHedkvist+is:closed">contributor</a>
			of the open source project called <a target=_blank href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>,
			which is a full stack framework for creating web applications. It
			is built using the programming language called Ruby. The framework gives developers the ability to spend time writing code and
			not waste their time on configuration. It is great in order to get started quick, hence I used it during my time at Unitalent.

			<br><br>

			<h3>Linkdagarna - Carrer Fair</h3>
			I were responsible for web development at a career fair called <a href="http://linkdagarna.se/">Linkdagarna</a> in Linköping University.
			As a part of the IT group I developed software systems using Django, Wordpress, React, Sass, Bootstrap etc.

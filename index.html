			<h3>2048 Replica</h3>
			<img class="img-header" src="images/2048.png">
			<p></p><a href="http://pierrehedkvist.com/2048">2048</a> is a game where you merge tiles with equal number which creates the sum of the two. You do this as long as you run out of space. The game I have created runs on any browser, using technologies such as Object-Oriented JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The game saves progress in local storage on the browser, so you can come back and continue where you left the game. Your best score will also be saved in local storage so you can improve. ✌️

			<h3>Esportsjobs.co</h3>
			<img class="img-header" src="images/esportsjobs.png">
			<p></p><a href="http://www.esportsjobs.co">EsportsJobs.co</a> is a job board for jobs in the Esports industry. I am adding jobs from different api’s and adding them to the site. Using phantomjs to fetch new jobs every hour I add them to site, and add appropriate tags based on location and required skills. Other businesses can then advertise their own jobs, in order to reach a bigger audience. The site is built using the Ruby on Rails framework, PhantomJS, Javascript, HTML, SASS and Bootstrap. I am a big fan of the Ruby language, because of its simplicity and ease of use.</p>
